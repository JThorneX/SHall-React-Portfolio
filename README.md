# SHall React Portfolio

React portfolio for a friend

## Description

Basic portfolio for a friend who doesn't necessarily need one (email linked to the form/button is not real, not all of the categories are filled out). This was made with React and the emailjs API - the main purpose of this project was practice with React and slightly more advanced CSS than I've done up to this point. I need to make a React portfolio for an assignment in the DU bootcamp I'm in, so using React was mandatory (though I do prefer it).

I didn't have many issues with the React itself, but the grid system in CSS still pains me and took far too long for me to sort out for each section. The practice was useful as it will be easier to do for my own portfolio.

## Usage

[The pages link](https://jthornex.github.io/SHall-React-Portfolio/) to view.

Otherwise, npm i to install dependencies then npm start to start server and view in browser on localhost.

## Credits

I followed a [tutorial](https://www.classcentral.com/classroom/youtube-react-portfolio-website-tutorial-from-scratch-build-deploy-react-js-portfolio-website-2022-140539) for this, with some tweaks of my own, to mainly understand where other devs begin to attack a project like this. Additionally, I am always looking for more CSS tricks and tips and I felt like I learned a fair amount from these videos.

I don't know about others, but when I open a new vscode, the blank slate can be very intimidating and I often struggle to figure out where to start. So for this project, I decided to follow a tutorial to begin to develop the habits of when to do what so I don't struggle in the beginning of a React project. I will not be using a tutorial for my own portfolio.
